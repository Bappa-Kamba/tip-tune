git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

---

## 📋 Before You Start Coding

### Find or Create an Issue

- Check [existing issues](https://github.com/yourusername/tiptune/issues) to avoid duplication
- For bugs, search closed issues - it might already be fixed
- For new features, open an issue to discuss before implementing
- Comment on an issue to express interest or ask questions

### Good First Issues

Look for issues tagged with:
- `good-first-issue` - Great for newcomers
- `help-wanted` - We need community help
- `documentation` - Improve docs
- `drips-wave` - Eligible for Wave rewards

### Issue Application (for Drips Wave)

If you're applying through Drips Wave:
1. Apply via the Drips Wave platform (not just GitHub comments)
2. Wait for maintainer approval before starting work
3. Only one contributor per issue
4. Respect the assignment - don't work on issues assigned to others

## 💻 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use automated tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

**Standards:**
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing code patterns
- Write meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): subject

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(player): add volume control slider

fix(wallet): resolve connection timeout issue

docs(readme): update installation instructions

test(tips): add unit tests for tip calculation
```

### Testing

All code contributions should include tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

**Test Guidelines:**
- Write unit tests for new functions and components
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for >80% code coverage on new code

### Stellar Integration

When working with Stellar:

- **Use Testnet** for development (never use mainnet keys in code)
- **Test thoroughly** - blockchain transactions are irreversible
- **Handle errors** - Network issues, insufficient balance, etc.
- **Document** - Explain Stellar-specific logic clearly

```typescript
// Good: Proper error handling
try {
  const transaction = await sendTip(artistId, amount);
  return { success: true, txHash: transaction.hash };
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE') {
    return { success: false, error: 'Not enough XLM' };
  }
  throw error;
}
```
